# Type definitions

Common flow type definitions.

Flow is a static type checker for JavaScript.

Flow adds static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality.

In particular, static typing offers benefits like early error checking, which helps you avoid certain kinds of runtime failures, and code intelligence, which aids code maintenance, navigation, transformation, and optimization.

## Code structure

Naming convention:
* Type `<TYPE_NAME>.type.js`

```
./src/types
├── common.type.js
├── goal.type.js
└── index.js
```
