# Redux

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
We use Redux for managing application state.

Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can’t be changed directly. When something changes, a new object is created (using actions and reducers).
