# Redux

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
We use Redux for managing application state.

Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can’t be changed directly. When something changes, a new object is created (using actions and reducers).

## Benefits Of Redux

* Predictability of outcome
* Maintainability
* Organization
* Server rendering
* Developer tools
* Community and ecosystem
* Ease of testing

## Code structure

```
./src/redux/
├── createStore.js // the store and its configurations
└── reducer.js     // the root reducer
```
